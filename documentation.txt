=====Summary=====
Created by Nic Duncan, Paul Davis, Brent Melby, and Kaitlyn Turner
This program is an assembler that creates object code for the SIC-XE assembly language.

=====headers.h=====
Used to initialize all functions and libraries used throughout the program.

=====directives.c=====
isADirective: Used to check if an inserted string matches a known system directive.

=====symbols.c=====
IsAValidSymbol: Checks an inputted symbol against SIC-XE criteria.
symbolExists: Searches a symbol table to make sure matching symbol does not exist already.
addSymbol: Finds the next free slot in the symbol table and inserts the validated symbol.

=====instructions.c=====
getOpcode: gets an equivalent opcode from a given instruction.
IsAnInstruction: Returns a boolean if the given string is a valid instruction or not.
getInstrMovement: Returns the byte movement/format a given instruction uses.

=====objectcodes.c=====
generateObjectcode: TODO
hexToBin: Converts a hexedecimal input to binary.
binToHex: Converts a binary input to hexedecimal.

=====main.c=====
main: Where pass 1 and pass 2 reside.
updateLocation: Gets the location counter movement from each line.
chopPrefix: Removes a prefix character such as +, #, or @ from a given input.


=====Error handling=====
Pass 1:
No empty lines present in the file
Ensuring the program does not exceed the SIC-XE memory limit of 2^20 bytes or 0x100000 bytes.
Validating that symbols meet SIC-XE's specifications such as starting with appropriate characters or being in all capital characters.
Watch for duplicate symbol creation.


Pass 2:
Check that valid symbol is referened by instructions.
Ensure that valid instructions and directives are used.
